# Laboratory Report and Presentation Guidelines

## Report Structure

For every laboratory activity, the report must include (but is not limited to) the following sections:

- **Brief introduction** or description of the experiences
- **Problem analysis**, if necessary
- **Relevant theoretical background**
- **Code structure and implementation choices**
- **Controller design**, if applicable
- **Results**
- **Conclusions**

### Suggestions for Writing the Report

- Describe the **design and implementation choices** you made
- List and/or describe the **tools** you used (e.g., Matlab)
- Explain **issues or problems** you encountered and how you worked around them
- Describe **problems not foreseen** during the design phase
- Include **graphs and measurements**
- Always **explain your thought process** that led to your solution; do not just describe the solution
- Use **appropriate technical/scientific language**
- If you had problems completing the experiences, clearly explain **why** and **what issues** emerged
- **Original solutions and observations** are always welcome:
  - Describe them whether they worked or not
  - Explain **why** they worked or **why not**

> ðŸ’¡ **Note**: Some groups were concerned because their controller was not perfectly calibrated.  
> The **performance of the controller is of secondary importance**.  
> Focus on clearly stating:
> - What was the **desired performance**
> - Why you were unable to achieve it
> - Possible **solutions** or improvements

**The report should not exceed 40 pages.**

## Presentation Guidelines

- The presentation is **teamwork**
- Must be made using **slides**
- Slides must be **uploaded to Moodle** at least **one day before** the presentation
- Presentation and discussion must be held in **English**
- You have **30 minutes** to present your work

### Team Distribution

- The distribution of slides and speaking parts is up to the team
- Suggested: **fair distribution** of both quantity and quality

### Presentation Content

- The presentation should **summarize the report**
- Clearly **explain requirements, objectives, and design choices**
- Clearly **state what was achieved** and **how**

> ðŸš« Avoid:
> - Making the presentation a **code summary**
> - Including **long sections of code** (only short excerpts if needed)

> âœ… Recommended:
> - Use **pictures, diagrams, schematics**, and **visuals**
> - Use **flow charts** to describe program execution instead of large blocks of text

### Post-Presentation

- A **Q&A session** will follow, focusing on:
  - Laboratory activity
  - Theoretical aspects discussed throughout the course
